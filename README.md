# chibitales.org - Milestone Project 1
Blockchain gaming! It's still a niche product, not easily accessible for Jane or Joe Doe. But it promises users not only the fun of digital gaming but the OWNERSHIP of the content created by playing the game.

One of the most promising games around is Chibi Fighters 2: A multi-platform, browser based mixture between TCG (Trading Card Game), IDLE and potentially PVP (player vs player) game. Unfortunately, based on blockchain technologies, it’s still struggling to find its user base.

chibitales.org aims to close that gap and provide potential new players with all the information necessary to set up an account, a wallet, to start playing the game and to support the project via kickstarter.com – in a well styled, easy to use, understandable and visually appealing manner.

## UX
So far neither Chibi Fighters 2 nor its website provide much guidance to new players, not familiar with the technology. On chibitales.org new players will find all the information and resources needed just two clicks away:

* You want to find out what the game is about - take a look at the main page.

* You want to know how to set up an account - click Setup, Account.

* You want to know how to buy packs - click Setup, Buy Packs.

* You need an Ethereum wallet - click Wallet.

* You want to know how to open your packs - click Play - Open Packs.



!! Wireframe links !!

## Features
* The hero image and navigation will provide all users with a visual impression of the game .

* The footer will provide all relevant social media links, sorted by relevance in reading direction.
 
* Potential players, which in this case are users and investors alike, will find general information about the game and all necessary warnings on the main page.

* Setup will guide users through the process of setting up an account.

* Wallet will give all necessary information on how to create an Ethereum wallet and how to put some money into it.

* Play will contain four sections giving tips on how to play the game:

  * Adventures
  * Raids
  * Hunt
  * Match

* Across all pages there will be directly accessible links to buy game packs and to support via kickstarter.
